Flyweight design pattern is used when we need to create a lot of Objects of a class. Since every object consumes memory space that can be crucial for low memory devices, such as mobile devices or embedded systems, flyweight design pattern can be applied to reduce the load on memory by sharing objects.

To apply flyweight pattern, we need to divide Object property into intrinsic and extrinsic properties. Intrinsic properties make the Object unique whereas extrinsic properties are set by client code and used to perform different operations. For example, an Object Circle can have extrinsic properties such as color and width.
