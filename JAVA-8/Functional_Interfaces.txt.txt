An interface with only single abstract method is called functional interface. we can either use the predefined functional interface provided by Java or create our own functional interface and use it.

While creating our own functional interface, mark it with @FunctionalInterface annotation, this annotation is optional,
we should use it so that we get a compilation error if the interface we marked with this annotation is not following the rules of functional interfaces.

The functional interface should have Only one abstract method. Along with the one abstract method, they can have any number of default and static methods.

************ What is difference between interface and functional interface?
functional interfaces have one abstract method defined in them so that Lambda could be called against them, while interfaces in general donâ€™t have this restriction. They can have one or more abstract methods or even zero in case of marker interface.

Predefined Functional Interface :
Function<T,R> - Represents a function that accepts one argument and produces a result.
Consumer<T> - Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.
BiConsumer<T,U>	- Represents an operation that accepts two input arguments and returns no result.
BiFunction<T,U,R> - Represents a function that accepts two arguments and produces a result.
BinaryOperator<T> - Represents an operation upon two operands of the same type, producing a result of the same type as the operands.
BiPredicate<T,U> - Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of two arguments.

@FunctionalInterface
interface Square {
  int calculateSquare(int x);
}
public class Test {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    int num = 10;
    //lambda expression to define the calculate method
    Square sq = (int x) - >x * x;
    int answer = sq.calculateSquare(num);
    System.out.println("The square of the number is: " + answer);
  }
}
****** Why do we need Functional interface in Java? ******
Functional Interfaces are mainly used in Lambda expressions, Method reference and constructor references.

In functional programming, code can be treated as data. For this purpose Lambda expressions are introduced. They can be used to pass a block of code to another method or object.

Functional Interface serves as a data type for Lambda expressions. Since a Functional interface contains only one abstract method, the implementation of that method becomes the code that gets passed as an argument to another method.
