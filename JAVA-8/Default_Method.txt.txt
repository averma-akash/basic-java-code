If several classes such as A, B, C and D implements an interface XYZInterface then if we add a new method to the XYZInterface, 
we have to change the code in all the classes(A, B, C and D) that implements this interface.
default methods can be added to any existing interface and we do not need to implement these methods in the implementation classes mandatorily,
thus we can add these default methods to existing interfaces without breaking the code.

Static methods in interfaces are similar to the default methods except that we cannot override these methods in the classes that implements these interfaces.
