Comparable: A comparable object is capable of comparing itself with another object. The class itself must implements the java.lang.Comparable interface in order to be able to compare its instances.

Comparator: A comparator object is capable of comparing two different objects. The class is not comparing its instances, but some other classâ€™s instances. This comparator class must implement the java.util.Comparator interface.

	Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
	Comparable affects the original class, i.e., the actual class is modified.
	Comparable provides compareTo() method to sort elements.
	Comparable is present in java.lang package.	
	We can sort the list elements of Comparable type by Collections.sort(List) method.
	
	
	The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.
	Comparator doesn't affect the original class, i.e., the actual class is not modified. 	 
	Comparator provides compare() method to sort elements.
	A Comparator is present in the java.util package.
	We can sort the list elements of Comparator type by Collections.sort(List, Comparator) method.
