Whenever hashcode is invoked on the same object more than once during an execution of a Java application, the hashCode method must consistently return the same integer, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the object is modified. This integer need not remain consistent from one execution of an application to another execution of the same application.

If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result

It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results. However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hashtables.


****** What will be the problem if you do not override hashcode() method? **********

Some collections, like HashSet, HashMap or HashTable use the hashcode value of an object to find out how the object would be stored in the collection, and subsequently hashcode is used to help locate the object in the collection. Hashing retrieval involves:

First, find out the right bucket using hashCode().
Secondly, search the bucket for the right element using equals()
If hashcode() in not overridden then the default implementation in Object class will be used by collections. This implementation gives different values for different objects, even if they are equal according to the equals() method.

Example:

public class Student {
    private int id;
    private String name;
    public Student(int id, String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.id = id;
    }
    public int getId() {
        return id;
    }
    public void setId(int id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}

public class HashcodeEquals {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student alex1 = new Student(1, "Alex");
        Student alex2 = new Student(1, "Alex");
        System.out.println("alex1 hashcode = " + alex1.hashCode());
        System.out.println("alex2 hashcode = " + alex2.hashCode());
        System.out.println("Checking equality between alex1 and alex2 = " + alex1.equals(alex2));
    }
}
Output

alex1 hashcode = 1852704110
alex2 hashcode = 2032578917
Checking equality between alex1 and alex2 = false
