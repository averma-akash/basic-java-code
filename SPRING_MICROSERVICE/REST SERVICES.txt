************** What is REST ? ************** 

The term REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style that defines a set of rules in order to create Web Services. In a client-server communication, REST suggests to create an object of the data requested by the client and send the values of the object in response to the user.

The key elements of the REST API paradigm are

a client or software that runs on a userâ€™s computer or smartphone and initiates communication;
a server that offers an API as a means of access to its data or features; and
a resource, which is any piece of content that the server can provide to the client (for example, a video or a text file).
To get access to a resource, the client sends an HTTP request. In return, the server generates an HTTP response with encoded data on the resource. Both types of REST messages are self-descriptive, meaning they contain information on how to interpret and process them.

************** What happens when we return a bean from a Request Mapping Method? **************

It depends on how we have configured spring. If the controller is marked as RestController and it's method return a bean the bean is either serialized into json or xml based on our configuration.. If we try to pass a bean from controller method and the controller is annotated as @Controller we will get a server error. Because a controller marked as @Controller usually returns a string or ModelAndView which will resolve to a jsp. Still if you want to return a bean from a controller method which has @Controller you can add annotation to the controller method with @ResponseBody the bean will be serialized to either json or xml based on configuration .
