Microservices or more Microservices Architecture is an SDLC approach based on which large applications are built as a collection of small functional modules. These functional modules are independently deployable, scalable, target specific business goals, and communicate with each other over standard protocols.

******* What is Spring Cloud? *******
Spring cloud is a set of tools that can be used by developers to quickly build some common patterns in distributed systems such as service discovery, configuration management, intelligent routing, etc.

******* Features of Spring cloud ******
a) Service registration and discovery
b) Routing
c) Service to service calls
d) Distributed and versioned configuration
e) load balancing and circuit breakers

******* Load Balancing *******

Load balancing is a technique used to improve the distribution of workloads across several computing resources, such as a computer cluster, CPUs, network lines, and disk drives.
We can implement load balancing in the Spring cloud using Netflix Ribbon.

******** Service Registration & Discovery ********


******** What is Hystrix? ********
Hystrix is a fault-tolerance and latency library designed for isolating points of access to remote systems, third-party libraries, services, stopping cascading failures, and enabling resilience in complex distributed systems where failure is common and cannot be avoided.
