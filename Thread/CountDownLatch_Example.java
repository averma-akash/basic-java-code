/*CountDownLatch âˆ’ 


It is a tool that enables main threads to wait until mandatory operations are performed and completed by other threads. In simple words, it makes sure that a thread waits until the execution in another thread completes before it starts its execution. One cannot reuse the same CountDownLatch once the count reaches 0. 

A synchronization technique that allows one or more threads to wait until a set of operations being performed in other threads completes.
It maintains a count of tasks
Only current thread will throw InterruptedException. It will not impact other threads
