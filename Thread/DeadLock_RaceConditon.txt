****** Race Condition *******

A condition in which the critical section (a part of the program where shared memory is accessed) is concurrently executed by two or more threads. It leads to incorrect behavior of a program.

There are two types of race conditions:

Read-modify-write
Check-then-act

Why it occurs?
It occurs when two or more threads operate on the same object without proper synchronization and their operation incorporates each other.

How to avoid it?
There are the following two solutions to avoid race conditions.

Mutual exclusion
Synchronize the process

In order to prevent the race conditions, one should ensure that only one process can access the shared data at a time. It is the main reason why we need to synchronize the processes.

Another solution to avoid race condition is mutual exclusion. In mutual exclusion, if a thread is using a shared variable or thread, another thread will exclude itself from doing the same thing.


**** DeadLock *******

Deadlock is a situation when a thread is waiting for a resource, that is acquired by second thread and second thread is waiting for an resource that is acquired by first thread.

Deadlock can arise if the following four conditions hold simultaneously (Necessary Conditions) 

Mutual Exclusion: One or more than one resource are non-shareable (Only one process can use at a time) 
Hold and Wait: A process is holding at least one resource and waiting for resources. 
No Preemption: A resource cannot be taken from a process unless the process releases the resource. 
Circular Wait: A set of processes are waiting for each other in circular form.
