Association is a connection or relationship between two separate classes.It shows how objects of two classes are associated with each other.
Association is a kind of relationship between classes whose objects have an independent lifecycle and there is no ownership between the objects. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many.

Example : In our project we have diffrent module like disclosure and statements, these module object is not dependent.

class Person {
  String name;
  long id;
  Person(String name, long id) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
  }
}
class Passport extends Person {
  String personName;
  Passport(String name, long id) {
    super(name, id);
    this.personName = name;
  }
}
public class GovernmentAgency {
  public static void main(String args[]) {
    Passport obj = new Passport("Divya", 99884444);
    System.out.println(obj.personName + " is a person with a passport number: " + obj.id);
  }
}

Divya is a person with a passport number: 99884444

In the above example, there is a one to one association between two classes: Person and Passport. Both the classes represent two separate entities.
